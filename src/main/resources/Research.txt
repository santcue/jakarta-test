Difference between sendRedirect and getRequestDispatcher

- getRequestDispatcher("/students.html").forward(req, resp)

This code uses the RequestDispatcher to forward the request
internally within the server to the /students.html resource.
The original request and response are passed directly to the
destination resource. The user does not notice this process and
does not see changes in the URL in the browser's address bar.

- resp.sendRedirect(req.getContextPath() + "/students.html")

This code tells the user's browser to make a new request to
the specified URL, which is /students.html preceded by the
application context (obtained with req.getContextPath()).
This results in a visible change of the URL in the browser's
address bar. The server responds with a 302 HTTP status code,
directing the browser to the new location.
