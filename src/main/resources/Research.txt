Difference between sendRedirect and getRequestDispatcher

- getRequestDispatcher("/students.html").forward(req, resp)

This code uses the RequestDispatcher to forward the request
internally within the server to the /students.html resource.
The original request and response are passed directly to the
destination resource. The user does not notice this process and
does not see changes in the URL in the browser's address bar.

- resp.sendRedirect(req.getContextPath() + "/students.html")

This code tells the user's browser to make a new request to
the specified URL, which is /students.html preceded by the
application context (obtained with req.getContextPath()).
This results in a visible change of the URL in the browser's
address bar. The server responds with a 302 HTTP status code,
directing the browser to the new location.

Cookies

Cookies are small text files that a web server can save to the
user's browser. They contain user or session specific data that
can be used by the server each time the user visits the site.

Sessions

Sessions are a way of storing information on the server to be
used throughout a user's visit (a session), providing a way to
persist data across multiple browser requests.

Differences

- Cookies are stored in the user's browser, while sessions use the server to store data.
- Using sessions can consume more server resources, while cookies use client storage.
- Cookies can remain stored in the browser for years (if configured to do so), while sessions are usually limited to the duration of the user's visit.
